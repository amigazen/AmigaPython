                          Last update: 17-Nov-96

                               BETA VERSION

***************************************************************************

As  this  document  describes  the  BETA VERSION of the ARexx support there
might  be  changes  to what is described below.  This depends on bugs found
and  suggestions  received.   So please:  test the ARexx support and let me
hear any problems/bugs/suggestions (ijong@gak.nl).

NOTE:  The ARexx support relies on the dos.library support; please read the
documentation on that subject first (Dos_module, python module dos.py).


***************************************************************************

                              MODULE: arexxll

                            File: N/A (builtin)

***************************************************************************

This module provides the lowlevel ARexx functionality.

IMPORTANT:   It  is  DISCOURAGED to use this module directly, use the arexx
module instead (see below).  This is because it is quite likely that in the
future  some things will be changed in this module.  Furthermore, using the
arexx module instead is much easier.


This module defines:

  error		- The exception that will be raised when an
		  error occurs related to ARexx. ('arexx.error')

  port()	- Function returning a new lowlevel ARexx port object.
		  The lowlevel ARexx port object is NOT DOCUMENTED.
		  Use a higher-level object from the ARexx module instead.

  errorstring()	- Returns string associated with arexx error number:
		  str = arexxll.errorstring(number)


ARexx message objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  module  also implements the ARexx message object.  A message arriving
at  a  ARexx  port  will  be  returned  as  a  ARexx  message  object (type
'arexxmsg'), which has the following attributes:

  reply()	- replies the message with the given results.
		  See rc, rc2 and result.  Each message must be replied to!
		  Messages which are deleted will be replied automatically,
		  if this is not yet done.
  setvar()	- sets ARexx variable for result: setvar('varname','value')
  getvar()	- get value of ARexx variable from caller's environment

  wantresult	- does the message require a result string? (int/bool)
  msg		- the message itself (string)
  rc		- result code for reply() (int)
  rc2		- secondary (error) result (string or None)
  result	- result string (string or None)

For  details  on  passing  results to the calling application/ARexx script,
refer  to  the  topic  below,  "HOW  RESULTS ARE PASSED BACK TO THE CALLING
APPLICATION".



***************************************************************************

                               MODULE: ARexx

                              File: ARexx.py

***************************************************************************

This  module  implements  the  Python  ARexx support classes and such.  You
should  use  this module and not arexxll directly, if your code must remain
compatible with future versions.

This module defines:

  error		- The exception that will be raised when an
		  error occurs related to ARexx. This is the same
		  exception as the one in the arexxll module.
		  ('arexx.error')

  errorstring()	- Returns string associated with arexx error number:
		  str = arexxll.errorstring(number)

  RC_OK		- ARexx 'success' return code (0)
  RC_WARN	- ARexx 'warning' return code (5)
  RC_ERROR	- ARexx 'error' return code (10)
  RC_FATAL	- ARexx 'severe failure' return code (20)


class `port'
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is  the message port abstraction.  Don't create objects of this class
directly!   Instead,  use  one  of  the  derived  classes  `privateport' or
`publicport'.   This  class  is  used  as base class for other port classes
only.


class `privateport' (derived from `port')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is  the  private  ARexx port abstraction.  The port is a private one,
which  means  it  has no name (and is therefore not public) and can only be
used to send ARexx messages to other ports (which are public).

Privateport objects are created as follows:
	p = arexx.privateport()

Attributes of privateport objects:
  port		- The lowlevel ARexx port. DON'T TOUCH.
  signal	- The AmigaDOS signal mask of the port.

Methods defined on privateport objects:
  close()
	Close the port.
  send(to,cmd,async=0)
	Send a ARexx message to another port. Currently, all pending
		messages (if any) are removed before the message is sent.
		to = name of port to send message to. (string)
		cmd = command to send (string)
		async = Asynchronous processing? Default=no (0).
	Asynchronous sends will not return a result, but synchronous
	sends do, so you should call this method like:
		result = p.send('REXX','\"return 4*8',0)
	which will put '32' in result. Errors are returned as a 2-tuple
	argument (rc,rc2) to the error exception.
  flush()
	Remove all pending messages (if any) from the port.
  wait()
	private-- behavior not documented for private port objects.
        Don't use it.
  getmsg()
	private-- behavior not documented for private port objects.
        Don't use it.


class `publicport' (derived from `port')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is the public ARexx port abstraction.  The port is public, so it must
have  a  name.  It can be used for receiving ARexx messages and for sending
them.  A publicport is the core of the ARexx host class, see below.

Publicport objects are created as follows:
	p = arexx.publicport()		# default portname PYTHON
	p = arexx.publicport('FOOBAR')	# portname FOOBAR

	When a port with the desired name already exists, sequence numbers
	are automatically appended to the name (PYTHON.1, PYTHON.2 etc).

	When you provide a name, it is converted to uppercase.
	If it is not a valid ARexx port name, error will be raised.
	Valid portnames consist of uppercase letters, digits, decimal
	points and underscores, and no other characters.
	

Attributes of publicport objects:
  port		- The lowlevel ARexx port. See arexxll module.
  signal	- The AmigaDOS signal mask of the port.
  name		- The actual port name.

Methods defined on publicport objects:
  close()
	Close the port.
  send(to,cmd,async=0)
	See privateport.
  flush()
	See privateport.
  wait()
	Wait until a message arrives. Currently the wait can be aborted
	with a ^C signal. This behavior might change in the future.
  getmsg()
	Receive a message. The message will be removed from the port,
	and it is returned as `message' object (see below).
	Returns None if no messages have arrived, i.e. this operation
        is non-blocking.



class `host' (derived from `publicport')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This   is  the  important  one:   this  class  is  a  complete  ARexx  host
abstraction!   It  contains  all  code  for  setting up the host, receiving
messages,  parsing  the commands and dispatching automatically.  Setting up
your own ARexx host has never been easier.

An ARexx host is created as follows:

	h = arexx.host()		# default portname 'PYTHON'
	h = arexx.host('FOOBAR')	# custom port name
	h = arexx.host('FOOBAR',cmds)	# custom port name + initial cmds

	The port name is used as a public port name. See the notes on
	public port names above, at class `publicport'.
	The third call above supplies an initial list of commands for this
	host. You may also install the list later using the setcommands
	member function.

The host has one default command built-in:

	HELP COMMAND,STEM/K,VAR/K

This  command  works  as  follows.   Without  args  it  returns  the set of
available  commands  like this:  <#commands> <cmd1> ...  <cmdN>.  A COMMAND
argument  gets  help  on  the  specified  command:  the command template is
returned.   The  result is usually put into the RESULT variable.  RC is the
error  code,  RC2  is  the  error string (if any).  Use the VAR argument to
specify a variable yourself to put the result into, instead of RESULT.  Use
the STEM argument to get the result in a slightly different format:

	HELP STEM X.

gets  the  list  of commands like this:  X.COUNT will contain the number of
result  values (i.e.  the number of commands), where X.1, X.2, X.3...  will
contain the individual results (i.e.  the commands).

The  default  help  service  is  implemented  in  the std_help_func command
function, which can be found in the ARexx module.


Attributes of host objects:

  commands	- dictionary of installed ARexx commands. Keys are the
		  commands, data is tuple of ArgParser object for the
		  template and the command function to call.
  cmderror	- error string for calling app when command is unknown.
		  Default is 'Unknown command'.
  catch		- will exceptions in ARexx commands be catched or not (0/1)
		  Default is 0; don't catch. Beware: the calling app may
		  freeze if your ARexx command raises an exception (because
		  the message is not replied to). Just exit Python and
		  all will be fine.
  name		- see publicport class
  port		- see publicport class
  signal	- see publicport class

Methods defined on host objects:

  close()
	Close the ARexx port (shutdown the host)
	You can also just delete the host object.

  setcommands(cmdlist)
	Specify a list of commands for this host.
	cmdlist = list of commands (4-tuple: command, template,
	defaults, function. See setcommand.)

  setcommand(cmd,templ,defaults,func)
	Install a single command for this host
	cmd = the command, for instance 'HELP'. Uppercase please.
	templ = the argument template, ReadArg() format, for instance
	        'COMMAND,STEM/K,VAR/K,AMOUNT/N'. See also the ArgParser
	        class from the `dos' module. You can also specify None,
		then no argument parser will be associated with this
	        command. This means that all arguments are passed straight
		to the command function. This can be used for creating ARexx
		commands with non-ReadArg() style arguments.
		Use the empty string if you want the command to have NO
	        arguments! This is different than None! 
	defaults = either None or a dictionary which specifies for some
	           keywords in the template what the default values are, if
	           the user doesn't specify them. Example: {'AMOUNT': 10}.
	           If you use None, some sensible values are chosen,
	           depending on the types of the keywords.
	func = the command function which is associated with this command.
	       See the topic, "HOW TO IMPLEMENT COMMAND FUNCTIONS".

  setdefaults(cmd,defaults)
	Install (new) default values for a command's argument template
	cmd = the command
	defaults = see above (setcommand)

  defaults(cmd)
	Query default values for a command's argument template
	cmd = the command

  catchExceptions(flag)
	flag= int/boolean argument:
	 0 : don't catch exceptions. When an exception occurs in an
	     ARexx command function, your program aborts (=default).
	 1 : catch exceptions. When an exception occurs in an Arexx command
	     function, it will be passed back to the calling application as
	     an error string, while your python program continues.
  dispatch()
	When a message is present, process it. The arguments will
	be parsed according  to the command's template and the
	correct command function is executed. The following
	return codes are defined:
	  -1 : there were no messages
	   0 : (false) a command function returned false, i.e. it failed
	   1 : message processed ok, command function executed ok

  flush()
	Process each pending message untill there are none left.
  run()
	Enter a wait/dispatch loop until one of the command
	functions returns false (0) or an error occurs.




HOW TO IMPLEMENT COMMAND FUNCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
They must be declared like this:
	def cmd_func(host,msg,cmd,args)
where
	host	= ARexx host object invoking this function
	msg	= the ARexx message which was received
	cmd	= the command which was called (string)
	args	= dictionary of arguments and their valued provided for
		  this command. See also ArgParser class from `dos' module.
		  Optionally, this is a regular string which contains
		  the argument line unchanged. This is the case when the
		  command has been added without an argument template.
		  See the setcommand memberfunction of the host class.

They  must  return  either 1 (true) or 0 (false).  0 indicates an error and
will  cause  the  `run' memberfunction of your ARexx host to abort (because
`dispatch' returns 0).


HOW RESULTS ARE PASSED BACK TO THE CALLING APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets call the message you've received from your ARexx host `M'.  First, you
might  want to check the value of M.wantresult.  If it is zero (false), the
calling  app  is not expecting any results (if it's an ARexx script, it has
not  set  `options  results').  If it is non-zero (true) the calling app is
possibly expecting a result value (Arexx script has set `options results').
Ofcourse  your  function  should  eventually decide if it needs to return a
result value.

M.rc  must  be  set  to  the  appropriate  ARexx return code (one of RC_OK,
RC_WARN, RC_ERROR and RC_FATAL).  By default it is set to RC_OK (0).

If  M.rc  is  RC_OK  (0), put the result string in M.result.  M.rc2 remains
unchanged  (None).   If  you  must  return  results in other variables, use
M.setvar  to  set them.  See the implementation of the default HELP command
for  how  this  can  be  done (the user can ask for the result to be put in
another variable, instead of RESULT).

If  M.rc  is  not  RC_OK  (0),  you should put a secondary result string in
M.rc2.  Usually this will be a string describing what went wrong.  M.result
does  not  need  to  have  a  value  in this case.  Other variables (set by
M.setvar) can still have a result value.

When  you're  done, you must reply the message.  This can be done by either
deleting  the  message  or  (better) by invoking M.reply() explicitly.  The
latter is not necessary but then you must make sure M gets deleted on time,
otherwise the message is not replied to, and the calling app will freeze.


HOW THE CALLING APPLICATION GETS RESULTS BACK FROM A CALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you require results and you are using an ARexx script, you should issue
the `options results' command first.  The following result variables exist:

  RC	- primary return code
  RC2	- secondary result (error)string, if RC != 0
  RESULT - regular result value.

If  RC is 0, all went well and RESULT will contain the result, if any.  RC2
has no value in this case.

If  RC  is  not  0, there was some error and RC2 will contain the secondary
result string, this is usually a string describing what went wrong.  RESULT
has no value in this case.

Sometimes it is possible to get the results in other variables than RESULT.
This  depends  on  the  function  you're calling.  The documentation of the
function   should  say  exactly  what  to  expect  from  it.   The  default
implementation  of  the HELP command is such a function:  you can specify a
variable yourself instead of relying on RESULT.


The `std_help_func' utility function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the default command function connected with the `HELP' command.  It
might be a good example of implementing a command function.  You might want
to  write  your  own help function, for example to give more extensive help
descriptions.   Just  use  the  `setcommand'  memberfunction to replace the
existing `HELP' command.  Do NOT change the source code of the default help
function!!!

The `std_debug_func' utility function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  you  use  this  function as a command function for a command, it will
print  out  some  debug  information  to  the screen and reply the command.
Useful for testing or for unfinished commands.

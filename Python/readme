|  1. What's new?      |
|                      |
+----------------------+

IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE THE PREVIOUS VERSION (version 1.4 Jan 12 1997):

    - Included the bugfixes which were available as a patch file, see below.
    - Some minor other fixes and changes.
    - Distributing the source code along with this archive.
      Look for `Python14_Src.lha' in the same place.
    - Recompiled with SAS/C 6.58.

  Fixed bugs:
    - possible enforcer hit or crash at exit (caused by wrong mempools code)
    - roundoff errors in mathmodule. random.py works again
    - readlink code (os.readlink) now works correctly

|  2. General remarks  |
|                      |
+----------------------+

* All tests in Lib/test ran successfully with my version.
  To try it yourself, type (after installation):
  cd Python:lib/test
  //Python -c "import autotest"  (and have patience...)
  //Python -c "import autotest"  (and have patience...)
  (Yes: do it TWICE because the generated .pyc files need to be checked too).
  Both runs should report 'all tests OK'.

* To  see  some  command  line  options,  use  the -?  option, or any other
  unrecognised option.

* The  `Docs'  directory  contains  2 text files regarding regular expression
  syntax,  and  some  other  documents.   You might want to copy other python
  documentation in here.

* In the `Docs/Amiga' directory you can find the docs for the Amiga specific
  modules and features. Read them, they contain vital information!

* In the `Icons' directory there are some icon suggestions.
  def_py.info is an icon for Python source files (.py)
  def_pyc.info is an icon for Pytnon bytecode files (.pyc)

* The following modules are built-in in this release:
	amiga		arexxll		array		binascii
	cmath		crypt		doslib		environment
	errno		grp		imp		marshal
	math		md5		new		operator
	pwd		regex		rotor		select
	socket		soundex		strop		struct
	sys		syslog		time		timing
	urlop

  Amiga specific: amiga, arexxll, doslib, environment
  Needs usergroup.library: crypt, grp, pwd.
  Needs AmiTCP's bsdsocket.library: select, socket, syslog.

* Mail  me  if  you encounter any Amiga specific problems, or if you have any
  Amiga  related  questions  about  Python,  or  just  for fun.  General
  questions are better asked on the usenet newsgroup comp.lang.python.  A lot
  of   information,   including  an  online  manual,  can  be  obtained  from
  <http://www.python.org/>,  or  <http://www.cwi.nl/www.python.org/>  if  your
  site is close to the Netherlands.  Read the FAQ before asking!

* Version 1.3 is no longer supported by me. Please upgrade to 1.4.

* Version 1.5 has already been released.  Amiga Python 1.5 is at the time
  of writing in beta. 


+-----------------------+
|                       |
|  3. Troubleshooting   |
|                       |
+-----------------------+

* When  I  try  to  install  Python,  I  get  "Unable  to  open  your tool
  'installer'"!

  The Installer® utility is required for installation, but it is not included
  in  the  archive.   Get  it  from  somewhere  else  and  copy it to your C:
  directory or somewhere where Workbench can find it.

* When I start python, I get "This program requires a math co-processor"!

  You have installed the wrong version. Pick the one with IEEE math.

* Python seems so slow!

  This  is  because Python is an interpreted language.  Some programs execute
  slow because of this.  Other programs can run fast, because they are written
  better, or make heavy use of the fast built-in (compiled) modules. Keep in
  mind that function calls in Python have quite big overhead.

* I   get   "Couldn't   open   bsdsocket.library"   or   "Couldn't   open
  usergroup.library" errors!

  You  are  trying to use functions that need one of these libraries.  AmiTCP
  is required if you want to use all (network) functions.

* Python crashes when executing complex (recursive) code!

  This should not happen; you should get a MemoryError exception.  If it does
  crash, increase your stack size and try again.  Python's default stack size
  is 20K, which should be enough for most programs.

* Functions which use the PIPE: device (like os.popen) seem to work
  incorrectly!

  The default l:queue-handler is buggy.  Make sure you have installed a fixed
  l:queue-handler (I'm using util/sys/HWGQueue.lha from Aminet)

* Other errors

  Mail me at ijong@gak.nl with a clear description of the problem.

|  4. Future           |
|                      |
+----------------------+

A bunch of ideas which might be implemented someday in the future:
   - interfaces to other Amiga libraries
   - GUI module for building python apps with a GUI
   - Support for other networking packages like I-Net
   - Use Executive's API (sysinfo.library, if available) for process stuff?
   - split python in several shared libraries
   - bugfixes (are there any bugs? Let me know)
